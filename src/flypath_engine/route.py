flypath_engine.route
--------------------
Concave-safe ordering of lawnmower scan-line segments into a flight route.

Pure Python (no QGIS) so the routing logic can be unit-tested directly.
generate_flight_grid() in grid_planner.py sweeps the survey polygon into
scan-line segments and hands them here to be grouped into contiguous strips and
snaked, so the drone never flies a pass across a gap in the survey area.
"""

# Two segments on adjacent scan lines belong to the same strip when their
# along-track (y) ranges overlap by more than this (metres). A real gap between
# strips gives no overlap, so the strips are kept apart and never flown across.
